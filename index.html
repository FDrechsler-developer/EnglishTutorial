                    Welcome everyone to our attempt to make a comic book style tutorial! <br>
                    I'm batman beyond (from the future) and I'll be your guide through some solutions to get better 3D printings.

                <p>Inside this huge box there is a 3D printer, an Ender 3 manufactured by Creality, which is currently undergoing maintenance and will serve to show some villains who sabotage 3D printing.</p>
            </div>  
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (6).jpg" alt="">
                <p>This is our time, Lex Luthor!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (8).jpg" alt="">
                <p>I'm sorry to disappoint you, guys. <br> I was not talking about you, but the real villains that live inside the 3D printing world. <br> You guys, don't exist in my alternative reality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (9).jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    That was embarrassing, Luthor! <br>
                    Don't worry, Joker. Let's drink something, I'll pay.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (3).jpg" alt="">
                <p> After this little interruption, I think we can start. <br>
                First of all, shut off the electrical power to avoid risk of electric shock or damage some device inside 3D printer. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (12).jpg" alt="">
                Thank you, Sup!
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (13).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Once inside, let's verify the first villain:
                    <br>*Misaligned Chassis or Frame.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (14).jpg" alt="">
                <p>With a small square verify each corner. The square must touch both surfaces to assure 90 degrees.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (15).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Even de upper corners must be checked.
                    <br>This verification is the most important. All machine parts are attached to the frame or chassis. If the chassis is misaligned it means that all the parts are misaligned too and it means mess.
                    <br> Here, all corners are ok!
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (13).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Next dangerous villain:
                    <br>*Looseness<br>
                    After misaligned chassis, looseness is the worse villain, although the easiest to eliminate.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (27).jpg" alt="">
                <p>With your hand, try to move up and down the axis X carriage. If you feel it is loose, it means that Axis Z is loose.
                    <br>Axis Z looseness does not allow a parallel movement X carriage to print bed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (16).jpg" alt="">
                <p>To solve this, tight all eccentric nuts to adjust Z V slots.
                    <br>V slots are simple parts with bearings that run within chassis profiles. To tighten them you must move the tool clockwise and release counter-clockwise.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (26).jpg" alt="">
                <p>With your hand try to move clockwise and counter-clockwise the hotend carriage.
                    <br> If it may be shaking, it means that 3D printing looks like shaking, losing precision and details.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (17).jpg" alt="">
                Tight the eccentric nuts in V slots to adjust hot end carriage.
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (28).jpg" alt="">
                <p>With your hand move slowly up, down, and clockwise. If you feel it may be shaking, it means the bed print carriage is not pushing and pulling the right way the axis Y.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (18).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Under the bed print there are two V lost, you must to adjust the eccentric nuts the same way that you done in axis Z or hot end carriage.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (19).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Another dangerous villain:
                    <br> *Dust.
                    <br> If you have an open 3D printer, beware with this silent evil.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (20).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Every time you clean up your house, lots of dust is spread through the air.
                    <br> This dust settles in your furniture, in your 3D printer, and your 3D print filament.
                    <br>Before each use, clean all possible parts of 3D print with a soft brush, removing all visible dust.
                    <br>For 3d print filament, there are many models of filters available on the internet to print. That certainly is a good update for your machine.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (21).jpg" alt="">
                This is not a villain, but after some time it can become one:<br>
                *The Nozzle.<br>
                If you print lots of pieces in a month, it's recommended to change the nozzle every month. This cheap part will keep you away from a good headache.<br>
                <br> WARNING:
                <br> To change the nozzle you must heat the hot end to a temperature between 195-230Â°C. So, use the right tool for this job, don't try to touch the heated nozzle with your bare hands.
                <br> There are lots of videos on youtube teaching how to proceed this change for each trademark.

                <p>Two more tips to finish this tutorial:<br>
                *Moisture
                <br> Moisture affects 3d print filament, creating bubles, stringing and weak printed parts.
                <br> After use, always keep the filament inside  well-sealed boxes with silica gel.
                <br> Open new filaments only if you are going to use them, they are hermetically vacuum sealed to prevent moisture and ensure durability.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (23).jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                *Speed
                <br>Beginners have a wrong idea about that: fast speed doesn't means good job. It only applies to industrial machines of thousants of dollars, not to entrance and hobbist models.
                <br>Speed inserts extra vibration, increasing printing temperature e flow of material. And only works with several tests. There is no recipe. So be gentle and pacient with your machines.
                <br>
