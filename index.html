                    Welcome everyone to our attempt to make a comic book style tutorial! <br>
                    I'm batman beyond (from the future) and I'll be your guide through some solutions to get better 3D printings.

                <p>Inside this huge box there is a 3D printer, an Ender 3 manufactured by Creality, which is currently undergoing maintenance and will serve to show some villains who sabotage 3D printing.</p>
            </div>  
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (6).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Now, is our time Lex Luthor!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (8).jpg" alt="">
                <p>I'm sorry to disappoint you, guys. <br> I was not talking about you, but real villains that live inside the 3D printing world. <br> In fact, you guys, don't exist in my alternative reality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (9).jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    That was embarrassing Luthor! <br>
                    Don't worry Joker. Let's drink something, I'll pay.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (3).jpg" alt="">
                <p> After this little interruption, I think we can start. <br>
                First of all, shut off the electrical power to avoid risk of electric shock or damage some device inside 3D printer. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (12).jpg" alt="">
                Thank you Sup!
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (13).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Once inside, let's verify the first villain:
                    <br>*Misaligned Chassis or Frame.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (14).jpg" alt="">
                <p>With small square verify each corner. The square must to touch both surfaces to assure 90 degrees.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (15).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Even de upper corners must to be checked.
                    <br> This verification is the most important. All parts in machine are attached to frame or chassis, one misalignment means all parts misaligned, that means mess.
                    <br> Here, all corners are ok!
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (13).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Next dangerous villain:
                    <br>*Loose<br>
                    After misaligned Chassis, loose is the worse villain and easier to eliminate.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (27).jpg" alt="">
                <p>With your hand, try to move up and down the axis X carriage, if you feel loose, means that Axis Z is loose.
                    <br>Axis Z loose doesn't allow to move parallel X carriage to print bed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (16).jpg" alt="">
                <p>To solve this, tight all eccentric nuts to adjust Z vslots.
                    <br> Vslots are simple parts with bearings that running within chassis profiles. To tighten you must to move the tool in clockwise and to release counter-clockwise.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (26).jpg" alt="">
                <p>With you hand try to move clockwise and counter-clockwise the hotend carriage.
                    <br> If It's loose, means that 3D printing looks like shaking, loosing precision and details.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (17).jpg" alt="">
                Tight the eccentric nuts in vslots to adjust hot end carriage.
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (28).jpg" alt="">
                <p>With your hand move slowly up and down and clockwise. If you feel loose, means the bed print carriage is not pushing and pulling the right way the axis Y</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (18).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Under bed print there are two vlost, you must to adjust the eccentric nuts the same way that you done in axis Z or hotend carriage.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (19).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Another dangerous villain:
                    <br> *Dust.
                    <br> If you have an open 3D printer, beware with this silent evil.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (20).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Every time that you clean up your house, lots of dust are spread through the air.
                    <br> This dust settles in you furniture, in you 3D printer and your 3D print filament.
                    <br>Before each use, clean all possible parts of 3D print with a soft brush, removing all visible dust.
                    <br>For 3d print filament, there are lot of models of filters available in the internet to print. That certainly is a good update for your machine.
                </p>

                This is not a villain, but after some time can become one:<br>
                *The Nozzle.<br>
                If you print lots of pieces in a month, its recommendable to change the nozzle every month. This cheap part will keep you away from a good headache.<br>
                <br> WARNING:
                <br> To change nozzle you must to heat the hot end to a temperature between 195-230Â°C. So, use right tool for this job, don't try to touch the heated nozzle with your bare hands.
                <br> There are lots of videos on youtube teaching how to proceed this change for each trademark.

                <p>Two more tips to finish this tutorial:<br>
                *Moisture
                <br> Moisture affects 3d print filament, creating bubles, stringing and weak printed parts.
                <br> After use always keep the filament inside boxes with silica gel and well sealed.
                <br> Open new filaments only if you are going to use them, they are hermetically vacuum sealed to prevent moisture and ensure durability
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img src="./cartoon/cartoon-real4 (23).jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                *Speed
                <br>Beginners have a wrong idea about that: fast speed doesn't means good job. It only applies to industrial machines of thousants of dollars, not to entrance and hobbist models.
                <br>Speed inserts extra vibration, increase printing temperature e flow of material. And only works with several tests. There are no recipe. So be gentle and pacient with your machines
                <br>
